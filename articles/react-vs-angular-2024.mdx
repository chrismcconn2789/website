### Premise

I set out to build a similarily styled and similarily functional todo/task list
application using both React and Angular to compare their setup, developer
experience, performance and general usability in 2024.

Both applications are deployed and hosted here:

[Angular Task App](https://angular-task-list.chrismcconnell.dev)\
[React Task App](https://react-task-list.chrismcconnell.dev)

---

### Setup for React

The React application was scaffolded using `bun` with Vite and following the
wizard steps, choosing React and Typescript

```bash
bun create vite react-task-list

✔ Select a framework: › React
✔ Select a variant: › TypeScript
Scaffolding project in /path/to/react-task-list...
```

The following packages and libraries were added to help with styling and user
feedback. Tailwind for styling, Akar icons for UI icons and uuid to handle task
list item unique ids

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@radix-ui/react-label": "^2.0.2",
    "@radix-ui/react-slot": "^1.0.2",
    "@radix-ui/react-toast": "^1.1.5",
    "akar-icons": "^1.9.31",
    "class-variance-authority": "^0.7.0",
    "clsx": "^2.1.0",
    "lucide-react": "^0.368.0",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "tailwind-merge": "^2.2.2",
    "tailwindcss-animate": "^1.0.7",
    "uuid": "^9.0.1"
}
```

---

### Setup for Angular

The Angular application was scaffolded using `node` with the Angular CLI and
following the wizard steps

```bash
npx -p @angular/cli ng new angular-task-list

? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? CSS
? Do you want to enable Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG/Prerendering)? No
```

The following packages and libraries were added to help with styling and user
feedback. Tailwind for styling, Akar icons svg copied for UI icons and uuid to
handle task list item unique ids

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@angular/animations": "^17.3.0",
    "@angular/common": "^17.3.0",
    "@angular/compiler": "^17.3.0",
    "@angular/core": "^17.3.0",
    "@angular/forms": "^17.3.0",
    "@angular/platform-browser": "^17.3.0",
    "@angular/platform-browser-dynamic": "^17.3.0",
    "@angular/router": "^17.3.0",
    "ngx-sonner": "^1.0.0",
    "rxjs": "~7.8.0",
    "tslib": "^2.3.0",
    "uuid": "^9.0.1",
    "zone.js": "~0.14.3"
}
```

### What is React?

React is a open-sourced Javascript libary managed by Facebook's React team
([React](https://react.dev)). It has a component based architecture and
declaratie views to create interactive and complex UIs. The main advantages of
using React include its reusable and predictable code, faster development time,
easier debugging and enhanced developer productivity.

React uses a virtual DOM for fast rendering, employs one-way data binding with
unidirectional data flow and has a smaller learning curve thus ideal for quick
developement. It comes with no batteries included and third party libraries are
needed to accomplish more complex logic but due to its popularity there is a
huge ecosystem of libraries available

Below is an example of the `TaskCard.tsx` component from the task list
application to show the colocation of concerns, incorporating the view and logic
in the same `.tsx` file.

**TaskCard.tsx**

```tsx
import { Task } from "@/types/task";
import { Button } from "./ui/button";
import { Circle, CircleCheckFill, Cross } from "akar-icons";

const TaskCard = ({
  task,
  onUpdateTask,
  onDeleteTask,
}: {
  task: Task;
  onUpdateTask: (taskId: string) => void;
  onDeleteTask: (taskId: string) => void;
}) => {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center p-2 justify-between bg-[#121217] rounded-xl my-1">
      <div className="flex items-center">
        <Button
          className="bg-transparent hover:bg-transparent gap-2"
          onClick={() => onUpdateTask(task.id)}
          tabIndex={0}
          aria-label="Check/Uncheck Task"
        >
          {task.completed ? (
            <CircleCheckFill
              className="text-cyan-300 outline-cyan-500"
              strokeWidth={2}
              size={20}
            />
          ) : (
            <Circle
              className="text-cyan-300 outline-cyan-500"
              strokeWidth={2}
              size={20}
            />
          )}
          <span
            className={`${
              task.completed
                ? "text-xs md:text-lg text-gray-100 font-light px-1 line-through opacity-40"
                : "text-xs  md:text-lg text-gray-100 font-light px-1"
            }`}
          >
            {task.item}
          </span>
        </Button>
      </div>
      <div>
        <Button
          className="flex gap-2 bg-transparent text-red-500 h-8 md:h-10 hover:bg-red-800/20"
          variant="destructive"
          onClick={() => onDeleteTask(task.id)}
          aria-label="Delete Task"
          tabIndex={0}
        >
          <Cross strokeWidth={2} size={16} className="md:size-4 size-3" />
        </Button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default TaskCard;
```

React is not very opinionated and allows you to develop the application how you
see fit. This can be somewhat of a drawback of React and there is no solid
conventions and how things should be done. Other drawbacks include that it's not
a complete framework but simply a library and those third party libraries may be
needed for large scale applications.

### What is Angular?

Angular is a full developement platform and application-design framework built
on Typescript with a similar component based architecture built and maintained
by Google ([Angular](https://angular.dev)). It is very much a batteries included
framework with integrated libraries, dependency injection and it's own Angular
CLI.

Angular has strong encapsulation and opinionated application structure. It is an
object orientated framework with an emphasis on classes. It has built in
features like RxJS, the Angular CLI and testing as well as built in support for
HTTP, Ajax and Observables. It utilizes two-way data binding, optimizes coding
practices and is focused on mid-level to enterprise scale.

Below is an example of the `app-task-card` components from the task list
application to show the separation of concerns, moving the markup and logic to
individual files.

**task-card.component.html**

```html
<div class="flex items-center p-2 justify-between bg-[#121217] rounded-xl my-1">
  <div class="flex items-center justify-center px-4">
    <button
      class="bg-transparent hover:bg-transparent gap-2 inline-flex items-center justify-center whitespace-nowrap rounded-md text-sm font-medium ring-offset-background transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50"
      (click)="updateTaskEvent(task().id)"
      tabindex="0"
      aria-label="Check/Uncheck Task"
    >
      @if (!task().completed) {
      <i class="ai-circle text-[#FD33C5] text-xl"></i
      ><span class="text-xs md:text-lg text-gray-100 font-light px-1"
        >{{ task().item }}</span
      >
      } @else {
      <i class="ai-circle-check-fill text-[#FD33C5] text-xl"></i
      ><span
        class="text-xs md:text-lg text-gray-100 font-light px-1"
        [ngClass]="task().completed ? 'line-through opacity-40' : ''"
        >{{ task().item }}</span
      >
      }
    </button>
  </div>
  <div>
    <button
      class="h-8 px-4 flex gap-2 bg-transparent text-red-500 md:h-10 hover:bg-red-800/20 items-center justify-center whitespace-nowrap rounded-md text-sm font-medium ring-offset-background transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50"
      (click)="deleteTaskEvent(task().id)"
      aria-label="Delete Task"
      tabindex="0"
    >
      <i class="ai-cross text-base"></i>
    </button>
  </div>
</div>
```

**task-card.component.ts**

```ts
import { CommonModule } from "@angular/common";
import { Component, input, output } from "@angular/core";
import { Task } from "../../../types/task";

@Component({
  selector: "app-task-card",
  templateUrl: "./task-card.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./task-card.component.css"],
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule],
})
export class TaskCardComponent {
  public task = input.required<Task>();
  public taskUpdateEvent = output<string>();
  public taskDeleteEvent = output<string>();

  public updateTaskEvent(taskId: string): void {
    this.taskUpdateEvent.emit(taskId);
  }

  public deleteTaskEvent(taskId: string): void {
    this.taskDeleteEvent.emit(taskId);
  }
}
```

### Developer Experience Comparison

#### React

A huge advantage to React in terms of dev experience is its popularity, meaning
there is lots of resources, guides, tutorials and Stack Overflow articles out
there. It is also very easy to get started with, anyone with an understanding of
HTML and Javascript will feel comfortable using React, although someone
unconventional in mixing the two in a JSX or TSX file the writing of Javascript
and HTML is the same. Another win for React is its flexibility, it isn't
opinionated on how developer should treat/write the code.

#### Angular

A massive selling point for Angular is that batteries included framework meaning
less of a need for third party libraries. It is focused on mid-level to
enterprise scale apps. It promotes a seperation of concerns by isolating the
view from the business logic in it's `component.ts` and `component.html`
structure. It is also opinionated on how the code should be structured, this can
be an advantage for those used to a OOP style programming paradigm but from
another perspective can be a steeper learning curve for new developers.

### Performance Comparison

Both React and Angular projects are deloyed to my VPS and built as a single page
application with the bundle being hosted via a Docker container and Nginx web
server.

First lets take a look at the bundle size between the two projects, the React
project `/dist` folder in the project directory that was output using
`tsc && vite build` command. The Angular project `/dist` folder that was output
using `ng build`.

#### Output Comparison

| Framework/Library | `dist` folder size |
| :---------------: | :----------------: |
|      Angular      |       381 KB       |
|       React       |       578 KB       |

We can see that Angular is a smaller output bundle compared to the React
application.

#### pingdom.com Comparison

Now lets take a look at some metrics when using a website performance benchmark
site such as [tools.pingdom.com](https://tools.pingdom.com).

| Framework/Library | Peformance Grade | Page Size | Load time | No of Requests |
| :---------------: | :--------------: | :-------: | :-------: | :------------: |
|      Angular      |      A - 92      | 129.8 KB  |   1.91s   |       10       |
|       React       |      A - 95      | 136.1 KB  |   1.22s   |       10       |

Here we find that although Angular is delivering a smalller page size it still
loses out to Angular in both performance grade and load time.

#### pagespeed.web.dev Comparison

Next lets use [pagespeed.web.dev](https://pagespeed.web.dev) specifically the
performance metrics.

| Framework/Library | Peformance Grade | First Contentful Paint | Total Blocking Time | Speed Index | Largest Contentful Paint |
| :---------------: | :--------------: | :--------------------: | :-----------------: | :---------: | :----------------------: |
|      Angular      |        85        |          0.6s          |        30ms         |    0.8s     |           0.7s           |
|       React       |        94        |          0.7s          |         0ms         |    0.7s     |           0.7s           |

Again here we see that despite Angular smaller bundle size it is marginally
slower in key performance metrics such as FCP, LCP and overall speed. This must
be caveat by the fact that bold are small simple todo list applications and a
much more complex mid to enterprise scale application may yield much more varied
results

---

### Conclusion

Whilst React is faster in perfomance metrics (i.e. on paper) and I personally
prefer to develop in Reacts less opiniationated and flexibility way of
functional programming both are viable options for building simple single page
application in 2024 and it really comes down to personal preference.

If you're a newer developer trying to choose your first library/framework to get
into web development then I would lean heavily towards React however if your
goal is to land a job in larger tech company then there's a high likelihood
they'll be using Angular and it may be more beneficial to know the key concepts
and paradigms of Angular (speaking from personal experience).

But these are only the opinions of one developer and in reality there is no
wrong choice, the important thing is being confident and understand the
fundamentals of HTML, CSS and Javascript, a framework/library will then be much
easier to learn and play around with, but that's the best thing to do, try both
options, try to build something interesting and enjoy the process.
